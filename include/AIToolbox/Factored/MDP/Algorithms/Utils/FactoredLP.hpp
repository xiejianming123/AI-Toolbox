     * @brief This class represents the Factored LP algorithm.
     *
     * This algorithm has been introduced in a number of Guestrin et al.
     * papers. The Factored LP algorithm takes part in approximately solving
     * factored state MDPs.
     *
     * The idea is that the Value Function for such a factored MDP is
     * approximated through a series of basis functions, which are chosen by
     * hand by the user. These functions are linearly combined in order to
     * produce as close an approximation to the real Value Function as
     * possible.
     *
     * This allows to limit the complexity of the Value Function when, for
     * example, iterating through the steps of Value Iteration.
     *
     * Note that the input Value Function in this algorithm should most likely
     * have been produced by some step which has made it not a linear sum of
     * the basis functions.
     *
     * This algorithm is thus used to find the coefficients that have to be
     * applied to the basis functions in order to approximate the input Value
     * Function. Once that's done, the basis functions can be summed and the
     * approximate Value Function constructed in order to continue whatever
     * algorithm is being executed.
